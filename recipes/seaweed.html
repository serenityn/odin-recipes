        <h1>Seaweed Soup</h1>
        <p>Seaweed soup, known as <strong>Miyeok-guk</strong>, is a soup made with seaweed, lightly seasoned broth, and protein (beef, chicken, clams, oysters, mussels, etc.).</p>
        <p>It is a tradition to eat <em>Miyeok-guk</em> for breakfast on one's birthday. Seaweed soup is associated with childbirth as it was given to mothers after childbirth, because it is rich in calcium, iron, and iodine. This led to <strong>Miyeok-guk</strong> becoming the Korean birthday soup.</p>
        <p>I prefer the vegeterian version, which is the recipe I am going to introduce.</p>
