        <h1>Japchae</h1>
        <img src="../img/japchae.jpg">
        <p>Japchae is a noodle dish mixed with an array of vegetables. It is usaually served on special occasions (known as a party dish) as a side dish/meal rather than the main meal.</p>
        <p>That being said japchae can be eating as a full meal as it includes starch, vegetables, and protein.</p>
        <p>I am sharing the <em>vegetarian</em> version, so there is no meat included in this recipe.</p>
